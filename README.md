# Purpose

This is the frontend code of an application that allows users to add entries (Slaylets) to a topic list (Slaylist), with notes to explain why they're adding it. Example use: a user can create a Slaylist of "Top Guitarists of Youtube" and link to 10 different Youtube channels, describing why each one deserves the spot.

First scope will be limited to Youtube account lists. Expansion ideas based on the native curation lacking notes or lacking any native option to curate that individual item:

- Instagram accounts
- TikTok accounts
- Spotify Artists
- Spotify Albums
- individual Youtube videos (playlists lack notes)
- individual Instagram posts (saved collections lack notes)
